# wine_analysis

For classification please go to 'ML-classification' directory. 

In many of the notebooks, I am simply exploring and trying out ideas. 

I created a tidied up summary of this exploration in the following notebooks: 


data wrangling: <br>
wine_classification_data_wrangling.ipynb <br>

Tuning of hyper parameters and evaluation: <br>
log_reg_CV.ipynb <br>
svm_CV.ipynb <br>
knn_CV.ipynb <br>
decision_tree_CV.ipynb <br>
random_forest_CV.ipynb <br>
